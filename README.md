Sqrl is a timetable planner for the University of Toronto.

## Features

-   **Modern design**: with colourful blocks showing your meetings and support for dark mode, you can almost take a bite out of those meetings.
-   **[Smart ass-search](https://xkcd.com/37/)**: smart search. Try it.
-   **Highly configurable**: show meeting times in your timetable, or not. Show lecture sections in your timetable, or not. Feeling devoid of emotion today? Try the monochrome palette. Make your own timetable your ownâ€”after all, this is your timetable.
-   **Localized**: supports English, French, and Chinese (simplified), because why not.
-   **Warns you**: about meetings that conflict with your existing meetings, and if you forgot to enroll in a particular section.
-   **Modern stack**: built with React, GraphQL, and Jest, we are Facebook's bitch. Also uses TypeScript, Next.js, Chakra, Flask, Elasticsearch, and MongoDB.
-   **NOT A CALENDAR**: Not a calendar app. Use a calendar app if you want to use a calendar.
